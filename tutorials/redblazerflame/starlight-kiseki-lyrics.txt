Mahiru no tsuki wa dokoka ni kiete
Mahou no uta mo kikinarete kita
Ano hi bokura ga egaita yume
Nan dakke naa oshiete yo nee


Hadashi no mama hashiru koto sura mo
Obiete ikiteta boku ga ite
Demo ima ja sore sura mabushikute
Urayamashikute nakeru naa


Ameagari no yozora wa
Itsumo yori sukoshi kirei de
Mizutamari hansha shita
Hoshi nara boku mo todoku ki ga shite


Sutaaraito aoi haru no naka de
Shuumatsu no yoru wo negatteita
Demo kimi ni deaeta kiseki no you na
Koi no kakera wo ima shinjitemo ii desu ka?


Kitto oboete ya shinai darou
Kotonoha ni kometa kanjou mo
Zutto koko ni wa irarenai
Dakara koso utsukushii


Sainou mo nakerya tsubasa mo nai
Asu no koto sura mo wakaranai
Tada kyou mo waraeteru
Aa sore wo kiseki to yonde mitai no


Sutaaraito aoi haru no naka de
Ryuusei wo ima minogashiteita
Demo kimi ni deaeta kiseki no you na
Koi no kakera wo ima shinjite miyou ka?


“Mukaikaze ga tsuyoi dake”
Sou itte waratta kimi ga ite
Shinu made wa ikite miyou
Kono amaoto wo mou sukoshi dake kimi to


Sutaaraito aoi haru no naka de
Shuumatsu no yoru wo negatteita
Demo kimi ni deaeta kiseki no you na
Koi no kakera wo ima shinjite yuku to kimeta
Futari no yoru ga akereba
Konna boku demo kimi wo suki de itemo ii desu ka?

ENGLISH TRANSLATION

The midday moon disappears to somewhere
I'm getting used to listening to magical songs
The dream we drew on that day
What was it? Please tell me
♪Starlight Miracle

Even running barefoot scares me,
Even running barefoot scares me, I've always lived my life like that
But now I start to find it dazzling
I'm so envious that I want to cry
The night sky after the rain
The night sky after the rain is a little more beautiful than usual
The puddle reflected it
I feel like even I can reach the stars

Starlight, in the midst of the blue spring
Starlight, in the midst of the blue spring I was hoping for the end of the night
But it was a miracle to meet you
May I believe in the fragments of love now?

I am sure you won't remember
I am sure you won't remember the feelings enveloped in the leaves of words
I can't stay here forever
That's why it is beautiful
I have neither talents, nor wings
I don't even know about tomorrow
But still, I'm laughing today
Aah, I want to call it a miracle

Starlight, in the midst of the blue spring,
Starlight, in the midst of the blue spring, I missed the shooting star just now
But it was a miracle to meet you
Let's believe in the fragments of love now?

"It's just because of the strong head wind"
You said so and laughed
Let's live until we die
I want to share, a little more of this rain sound

I want to share, a little more of this rain sound with you
Starlight, in the midst of the blue spring
Starlight, in the midst of the blue spring I was hoping for the end of the night
But it was a miracle to meet you
I've decided to believe in the fragments of love now

If the night of the two is over,
If the night of the two is over, can someone like me, still like you?
